# Agate Click Game

## Overview
In this project, I created a simple memory game with React. The goal was to break up the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

### Instructions
1. The application renders different images to the screen. 
2. Each time the user clicks on an image, the pictures are shuffled. The task for the user is to click on each image once and only once. 
3. The application keeps track of the user's score. 
4. If the user clicks on an image they're already clicked on in the current round, their Correct Guesses score is reset to 0.
